# compensateR
An R package used to compensate unprocessed data from environmental sensors for temperature and salinity. 

## Dissolved Oxygen
Temperature and salinity compensation performed using equations from Garcia and Gordon, 1992. Described and summarized here: https://water.usgs.gov/admin/memo/QW/qw11.03.pdf

## Conductivity
Calculation of specific conductance performed using a simple linear equation:

   **Specific conductance = conductivity /(1 - ((25-T) * 0.02))** 

Where: T = water temperature in degrees C
